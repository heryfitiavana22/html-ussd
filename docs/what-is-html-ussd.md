# Introduction

**HTML-USSD** is a command-line tool that simulates USSD navigation experiences based on structured HTML files.

## What is HTML-USSD?

USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) is a protocol used by mobile phones to communicate with a service provider's computers. It is often used for things like balance checks, top-ups, and service menus.

**HTML-USSD** lets you:

- Write USSD-like flows using simple, structured HTML.
- Simulate and navigate those flows directly inside a terminal.
- Develop and test USSD applications without needing a real mobile device.

## Key Features

- **HTML-Based Simulation**: Define screens and interactions with basic HTML tags.
- **Terminal Rendering**: Navigate menus and input forms inside your terminal.
- **Multilingual Support**: Built-in support for English, French, and Malagasy.
- **CLI Interface**: Launch simulations via a flexible command-line tool.
- **Offline or Online**: Load local HTML files or fetch them from a remote server.

## Supported Use Cases

- Rapid prototyping of USSD applications.
- Testing USSD flows before backend integration.
- Educational purposes for learning how USSD works.
- Building lightweight user interfaces without mobile devices.

## How It Works

HTML-USSD reads HTML files that follow specific rules:

- Extracts titles, text, links, and forms.
- Displays options interactively in the terminal.
- Accepts input and navigates based on user selections.
